Date:		October 2015
KernelVersion:	4.XX
Contact:	Greg Kroah-Hartman <greg@kroah.com>
Description:
		A bundle has a state that is managed by the userspace
		Endo process.  This file allows that Endo to signal
		other Android HALs that the state of the bundle has
		changed to a specific value.  When written to, any
		process watching the file will be woken up, and the new
		value can be read. It's a "poor-man's IPC", yes, but
		simplifies the Android userspace code immensely.
