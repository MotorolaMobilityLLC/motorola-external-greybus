 * (0x80) of the operation type field is used to indicate whether
 * the message is a request (clear) or a response (set).

 * communicates the result of the corresponding request.  A zero

 * response message (if any) is ignored.  The result byte must be

 * endian.  Any operation-specific data begins immediately after the
 * header, and is 64-bit aligned.

 * the sender.  Every operation has a type, whose interpretation is
 * dependent on the protocol associated with the connection.
 *
 * Only four things in an operation structure are intended to be
 * directly usable by protocol handlers:  the operation's connection
 * pointer; the operation type; the request message payload (and
 * size); and the response message payload (and size).  Note that a
 * message with a 0-byte payload has a null message payload pointer.
 *
 * In addition, every operation has a result, which is an errno
 * value.  Protocol handlers access the operation result using
 * gb_operation_result().
